<P> The idea for writing this library grew out of our own need for a
 high quality graph drawing library for PHP. When evaluating potential
 existing libraries we found (at that time around 2000) these three</P>
<OL>
<LI> &quot;chart 0.3&quot; http://quimby.gnus.org/circus/chart/chart-0.3.tar.gz,
 by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen</LI>
<LI> &quot;ykcee.php&quot;, http://ykcee.sourceforge.net</LI>
<LI> &quot;phplot.php&quot;, http://www.phplot.com</LI>
</OL>
<P> All these libraries implements some fine graphic features but
 unfortunately none of those completely fulfilled our needs either for
 available functionality (for example none of these supported both two
 Y-scales, auto-scaling, and logarithmic scales), or general
 flexibility. We especially needed the option of two Y-scales, which
 none of the above packages supported. Our own preferences for design
 was closest to &quot;chart 0.3&quot; so we started by fixing some bugs in that
 package and adding some new features. However It was soon realized that
 to add all the features and flexibility we needed to &quot;chart 0.3&quot; it
 would require a complete rewrite since the original design wasn't
 flexible enough, especially adding a second Y-scale would require a
 more flexible OO architecture.</P>
