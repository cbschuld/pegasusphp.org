<H2><A NAME="4_7">4.7  Working with fonts in JpGraph</A></H2>
<P> JpGraph supports both a set of built in bit-mapped fonts as well as
 True Type Fonts. For scale values on axis it is strongly recommended
 that you just use the built in bitmap fonts for the simple reason that
 they are, for most people, easier to read (they are also quicker to
 render). Try to use TTF only for headlines and perhaps the title for a
 graph and it's axis. By default the TTF will be drawn with
 anti-aliasing turned on.</P>
<P> In many of the example you can see examples of both TrueType and
 Bitmap fonts.</P>
<P> There are a number of subtle differences in the way builtin fonts
 and TrueType fonts are rendered to the screen. However, JpGraph,
 abstracts away 99.9% of the differences so it will be, for the user,
 completely transparent to switch between the different fonts.</P>
