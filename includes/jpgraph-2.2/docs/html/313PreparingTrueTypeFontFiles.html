<P> JpGraph contains as default a standard set of bitmap fonts which
 only supports the standard ASCII 7-bit character set. In order to use
 accented characters, UTF-8, Chinese, Japanese, etc You need to download
 TTF fonts. Due to various legal issues no TTF fonts are supplied in the
 JpGraph package. To enable TTF fonts there are three alternatives:</P>
<OL>
<LI>If you are on a Windows platform you can just point to the TTF
 directory in JpGraph to the standard fonts directory (e.g
 C:\windows\fonts\)</LI>
<LI>If you are on a Unix platform you can download and install the core
 MS WEB-initiative fonts from <A href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">
http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/</A></LI>
<LI>It is also possible to use the Vera Bitstream TTF fonts available
 from <A href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">http://www.gnome.org/fonts/</A>
</LI>
</OL>
<P> It is also necessary to make sure that the PHP installation supports
 TTF fonts (either through FreeType 1 or FreeType 2 libraries). I n
 addition some suitable TTF font files must also be available. To make
 the font files available for the library the directory path to the
 location of the font files must be specified in the configuration file,
 jpg-config.inc.php</P>
<P> JpGraph uses a standard naming convention for the TTF font files in
 order to be able to find the correct font files. This naming convention
 follows the standard naming of the available font files.</P>
<P> If the installation of the library is made on a computer running MS
 Windows then it is recommended to use the already available font files
 in Windows (usually located in C:\WINDOWS\FONTS).</P>
<P> If the installation is made on a UNIX derivate running X11 then the
 font location can differ between versions and UNIX brands. One commonly
 used path is &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype/&quot;.</P>
<P> Finally we note that it is possible to install additional fonts not
 natively supported by the library. Since this requires augmenting the
 library files this is considered advanced use and not further discussed
 in this introduction.</P>
