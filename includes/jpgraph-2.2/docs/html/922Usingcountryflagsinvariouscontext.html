<H2><A NAME="9_22">9.22 Using country flags in various context</A></H2>
<P> JpGraph has built-in support for over 200 country flags, i.e. they
 are available to be used in graphs without any external image
 definitions.</P>
<P> Country flags can be used in primarily two settings</P>
<OL>
<LI> As image markers in line and scatter graphs</LI>
<LI> As background images for graphs</LI>
<LI> As a special type of icons (using the IconPlot()) which can be
 added to the graph in any arbitrary position. See next section</LI>
</OL>
<P> In order to make it easy to find the appropriate country flags they
 can be specified with either full or partial name or as an numeric
 index. The routines in JpGraph are &quot;smart&quot; enough to figure out which
 way you are trying to specify a particular flag.</P>
<P> To specify a country flag as a marker you have to specify the
 special mark type as one of MARK_FLAG1,MARK_FLAG2,MARK_FLAG3 or
 MARK_FLAG4</P>
<P> Flags are internally stored in 4 different sizes which is indicated
 by the number in the mark types. Flags may also be arbitrary scaled
 when displayed. Since this is partially overlapping functionality you
 might very well ask why the flags are stored in four different basic
 sizes. The reason is of course performance. It you only want a very
 small flag it takes processing time to scale down a large image to,
 say, a small icon size. At the same time for large flags to be used as
 background a small original flag might not have enough details to be
 scaled up to a large size. Hence the reason for storing the flags in 4
 different sizes.</P>
<P> The example below shows how to use country flags as markers<DIV class="example">
<BR> <A href="exframes/frame_markflagex1.html" target="blank"><IMG border="0"
HEIGHT="200"       src="img/img/img/img/img/img/markflagex1.png" WIDTH="300"></A>
<BR><B>Figure 183:</B> Using country flags as line plot markers <A href="exframes/frame_markflagex1.html"
target="blank">[src]</A>&nbsp;
<P></P>
</DIV></P>
<P> To use country flags as background one has to use the method
 Graph::SetBackgroundCountryFlag(). With this method you can specify
 both how much of the image should be filled as well as how much of the
 flag should be mixed into the background.</P>
<P> To see a list of all supported country flags you can run the script
 &quot;listallcountryflags.php&quot; in the Example directory. This will show you
 a table with all flags.</P>
