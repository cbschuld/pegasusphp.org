<H3><A NAME="3_1_4">3.1.4 Using non-latin based fonts with JpGraph</A></H3>
<P> In addition to European font it is also possible to use non-latin
 based fonts such as Cyrillic, Japanese and Chinese.</P>
<P> In all cases a suitable TTF font that supports the non-latin based
 language must be available.</P>
<P> For Cyrillic support the define LANGUAGE_CYRILLIC in jpg-config.php
 must be set to true. It is then possible to use a suitable Cyrillic
 font as replacement for the ordinary fonts.</P>
<P> For Chinese character set JpGraph supports both BIG5 and GB2312
 encoding. For BIG5 encoding the PHP installation must have support for
 the &quot;iconv()&quot; function. Furthermore the define CHINESE_TTF_FONT must be
 set to the name of the Chinese BIG5 font that is to be used. By default
 this is set to &quot;bkai00mp.ttf&quot;. To use the Chinese BIG5 font in the
 scripts one must then specify the font family as FF_CHINESE.</P>
<P> To use the alternative font files &quot;simsun.ttc&quot; and &quot;simhei.ttf&quot;
 (which uses the GB2312 encoding) the only step needed is to install
 those fonts in the normal TTF font directory and then specify the font
 family as FF_SIMSUN, the &quot;simhei.ttf&quot; is used when the font style is
 specified as FS_BOLD.</P>
<H4>3.1.4.1 Japanese character support</H4>
 Using Japanese fonts are supported by the pre-defined font families
<UL>
<LI>FF_MINCHO</LI>
<LI>FF_PMINCHO</LI>
<LI>FF_GOTHIC</LI>
<LI>FF_PGOTHIC</LI>
</UL>
 Please note that the actual font files is not included in the library.
 The exact name of the font files to use for these families are defined
 in the the configuration file &quot;jpg-config.inc.php.php&quot;.
<P> Some care must be taken due to the encoding that the library
 expects. The library TTF handling expects the fonts to be encoded in
 UTF8 encoding. Since the most commonly used Japanese encoding is EUC-JP
 some conversion must be done. The best way to do this is by using the<I>
 mbstring</I> extension to PHP to handle the encoding. By default this
 module is not included and to compile PHP with support for mbstring the
 option &quot;--enable-mbstring&quot; must be given when compiling PHP. Your
 installation of PHP might also provide mbstring as a PHP module that is
 loaded at runtime.</P>
<P> To convert from EUC-JP the function<I> mb_convert_encoding()</I> is
 used as the following example shows.</P>
<PRE>
$utf8-encoded-text = mb_convert_encoding($eucjp-encoded-txt, 'UTF-8','EUC-JP');
</PRE>
 By enabling the define &quot;ASSUME_EUCJP_ENCODING&quot; (in
 jpg-config.inc.php.php) this encoding is done automatically in the
 library when one of the Japanese fonts have been enabled. By default
 this automatic conversion is disabled.
<P> If this define is false then it is up to the client to make sure
 that the proper utf8 encoded text is passed on to all the methods that
 are use to specify text in the library given that one of the Japanese
 fonts have been selected.</P>
<P> A different method also exists when it comes to Japanese font
 support. By compiling PHP with the option &quot;--enable-gd-jis-conv&quot; this
 will automatically convert Japanese characters to UTF8 when using the
 FreeType libraries. However the method with the mbstring module is
 preferred since the automatic conversion might on occasion fail to
 detect the proper encoding.</P>
